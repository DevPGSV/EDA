# Design and analysis of recursive algorithms

#### November 25, 2015

We need to code a **tail recursive algorithm**, as efficient as possible, that, for any two vectors of integers *u*, *v*, sorted in ascending order, returns the number of elements that appear in both vectors.

* **Specify** a recursive function to implement this algorithm.
* **Describe** the recursive approach you are going to use.
* **Justify** the case selection.
* **Write** the successor and termination functions.
* **Implement** the algorithm.
* **Implement** the *main* function, providing examples of the correct behaviour of the algorithm.
