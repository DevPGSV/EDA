# Design and analysis of iterative algorithms

#### November 4, 2015

* Given two arrays of characters, v1 and v2, and their corresponding lengths, l1 and l2, with l1 >= l2 >= 0, **specify and code** a function _subString_ that returns a boolean value stating whether v2 is contained in v1. Code the main function providing some test cases that prove that your *subString* function works. Calculate the **complexity** of your solution.
